# ArduiNode
ArduiNode is a browser visual arduino code editor, inspired by the blueprint system of Unreal Engine 4.

## Getting started
ArduiNode is now available in it's beta version [online](http://www.arduinode.net). You can start programming using ArduiNode right now by following the link. The details for the usage of ArduiNode are available on the [wiki](https://github.com/EtienneDx/ArduiNode/wiki/How-to-use-ArduiNode)

## Usage
Once on the application, you can simply add nodes by clicking on their names in the toolbar on the right panel, and add variables on the left panel.
Variables type and default values can be set by using the 'Details' button.
You can delete nodes / inputs connections by holding the 'Alt' key and clicking on the node / connector.

Once you're satisfied with your sketch, simply press the 'Generate code' button on the top left on the screen, and the code will be displayed in the middle of the screen.
You'll then be able to copy the code, paste it into a .ino file, and upload it to any Arduino card, by using the usual IDE.

You can also save your sketches to continue them later on, or take a look at the different examples to have an insight of the possibilities.

If you come across any issue while using ArduiNode or want to suggest a feature, please feel free to post [issues](https://github.com/EtienneDx/ArduiNode/issues).

## Getting ArduiNode on your machine
If you wish to take a look at how the program works, or to participate to it's creation, you can get it on your computer by following those steps :

### Prerequisites
The application uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to run.
You therefore need to [get npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) on your machine.

### Installing
Now that you have npm on your machine, clone the repository, open a command window in the 'arduinode' folder, and type this command :

    npm install

This command will install all the project dependencies. Once this command has finished to run, run another command :

    npm start

This will start the application into your browser, and you'll be good to go.

## Contributing
This project is still in development, and I'd therefore like any support you can provide, either from a feedback point of view and bug reporting, or from actual coding.
