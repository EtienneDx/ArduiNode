# Contributing to ArduiNode
When contributing to this project, any help is welcomed, as long as the changes follow the same goal as the project.

Before anything, please follow this simple code of conduct : be respectful and welcomming towards other members or non members of the project.

## Pull request process
* Once your code is written, please ensure to have it commented properly, so that other users can easily understand the changes you made.
* If your code changes anything referenced to in the readme, such as the interface or the user interactions, please change the readme as well.
* <!> Test your code before pushing it <!> Check whether your code passes the tests (npm run test), and whether the application still runs properly. One way to do so is to create a blinking led program, and a program using your feature (in case you added some nodes and or variables types)

Once your code fulfil those criteria, create your pull request, and I'll review it as soon as possible.

## Needed contributions
You can check the files for '// @TODO' comments, which just point out future changes needed to the code, or check the [project board](https://github.com/EtienneDx/ArduiNode/projects/1) for the list of remaining tasks.

Another way to contribute is evidently to report issues and suggest feature that would fit in the project.
